# vdoc — Documentation Generator

Run documentation workflows for this project. Full instructions are in GEMINI.md under the vdoc section.

**User request:** {{args}}

## If "init" or no vdocs/ folder exists:

1. **Explore** — Read the codebase: tech stack, features, architecture, integrations, entry points. Read actual files.
2. **Plan** — Write `vdocs/_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md` to disk listing proposed docs. Present to user. Wait for approval.
3. **Generate** — Read template from @.gemini/vdoc/doc-template.md once. Then generate docs **one at a time**: read sources → write `vdocs/FEATURE_NAME_DOC.md` → confirm → next
4. **Manifest** — Create `vdocs/_manifest.json` using schema at @.gemini/vdoc/manifest-schema.json
5. **Verify** — Every doc has mermaid diagrams, real paths, 2+ constraints, cross-references.

## If "audit" or vdocs/ already exists:

Follow the audit workflow at @.gemini/vdoc/audit-workflow.md
