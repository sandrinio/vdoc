# vdoc init — Generate Documentation

Generate feature-centric documentation from source code. All docs go in `vdocs/`. Do NOT create scripts, shell files, scanners, or any tooling — use your built-in tools (Read, Glob, Grep) for everything.

---

## Step 1 — Explore

Follow the two-phase exploration strategy in `references/exploration-strategies.md`:

**Phase 1 — Fingerprint** (3-5 file reads max)
Read package/config files and directory structure using Read, Glob, and Grep to identify the project's language, framework, and archetype. Also check for existing documentation (`vdocs/`, `docs/`, `product_documentation/`, substantial `*.md` files). If found, read them first — they're a head start. See the "Existing Documentation" section in `references/exploration-strategies.md`.

**Phase 2 — Targeted Exploration** (archetype-specific)
Apply the matching archetype playbook from `references/exploration-strategies.md`. Read files in priority order using the glob patterns listed. Identify feature signals — each signal maps to a documentable feature. Combine multiple playbooks when the project doesn't fit a single archetype (see "Composing Archetypes" in the strategies file).

If no archetype matches, use the Fallback strategy and confirm with the user.

Do not skim. Understand how the system actually works before proposing docs.

**Phase 3 — Write Exploration Log**
After exploring, write `vdocs/_exploration_log.md` documenting what you found:

```markdown
# Exploration Log

## Fingerprint
- **Language(s):** e.g., TypeScript, Python
- **Framework(s):** e.g., Next.js 14, FastAPI
- **Archetype(s):** e.g., Full-stack Framework
- **Scope:** e.g., ~85 files, medium

## Files Read
| # | File | Why | What I Found |
|---|------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | package.json | Fingerprint | Next.js 14, Prisma, NextAuth |
| 2 | src/app/ (listing) | Page tree | 12 routes, 3 API routes |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Feature Signals Detected
| Signal | Source File(s) | Proposed Doc |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Auth middleware + login page | middleware.ts, app/login/page.tsx | AUTHENTICATION_DOC.md |
| Prisma schema with 8 models | prisma/schema.prisma | DATA_MODEL_DOC.md |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Ambiguities / Open Questions
- Could not determine why Redis is in dependencies — no usage found. Ask user.
- Payments folder exists but appears incomplete / WIP.
```

This log is your working memory. It feeds directly into Step 2 (Plan).

## Step 2 — Plan

Create `vdocs/_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md` listing each proposed doc:

```markdown
# Documentation Plan

## Proposed Documents

1. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW_DOC.md** — Tech stack, architecture, project structure, dev setup
2. **AUTHENTICATION_DOC.md** — OAuth2 flow, JWT lifecycle, session management, RBAC
3. **API_REFERENCE_DOC.md** — All endpoints, request/response shapes, error codes
...

## Notes
- Each doc covers one logical feature, not one file
- Docs should be useful for onboarding AND as AI context for planning changes
```

Present the plan to the user. Actively suggest changes:
- "Should I merge X and Y into one doc?"
- "I found a websocket system — want that documented separately?"
- "Any internal/legacy systems I should skip?"

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

## Step 3 — Generate

For each approved doc:

1. Read ALL relevant source files for that feature — not just the main file, but helpers, types, middleware, tests
2. Follow the template below exactly
3. Write to `vdocs/FEATURE_NAME_DOC.md`

### Doc Template

```markdown
# {Feature Title}

> {One-line description of what this covers}

---

## Overview

{What it does, why it exists, how it fits in the system.}

---

## How It Works

{Core logic and flow.}

{Mermaid diagram(s) — max 7-9 nodes per diagram, split into multiple if larger.}

---

## Data Model

{Entities this feature owns and their relationships. Mermaid ER diagram or table.}

---

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/path/file.ts` | What this file does |

---

## Dependencies & Integrations

{External services, internal features, packages this relies on.}

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `ENV_VAR` | What it controls | Yes/No |

---

## Error Handling

{Failure modes, what the user sees, retry logic. Mermaid diagram if the error flow is non-trivial.}

---

## Constraints & Decisions

{Why it's built this way. What you CANNOT change without breaking things.}

---

## Related Features

{Cross-references to other docs by filename. Blast radius — what breaks if this changes.}

---

*Generated by vdoc v3.0.0 • Last updated: {timestamp}*
```

### Writing Rules

- **Mermaid diagrams are mandatory** in "How It Works". Show the actual flow — request lifecycle, state transitions, data pipeline. If a flow has more than 7-9 nodes, split into multiple diagrams.
- **Data Model** must show real entities from the code, not generic placeholders. Use mermaid ER diagrams for relational data, tables for simpler models.
- **Constraints & Decisions** is the most valuable section. Dig into the code for non-obvious choices: "Uses polling instead of websockets because...", "Auth tokens expire in 15min because...". If you can't find the reason, state the constraint and mark it: `Reason: unknown — verify with team`.
- **Related Features** must reference other docs by filename and explain the coupling.
- **Configuration** must list actual env vars/secrets from the code, not hypothetical ones.
- **Error Handling** — trace what happens when things fail. What does the user see? What gets logged? Is there retry logic?

## Step 4 — Manifest

Create `vdocs/_manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "project": "<project-name>",
  "vdoc_version": "3.0.0",
  "created_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "last_updated": "<ISO-8601>",
  "last_commit": "<short-sha>",
  "documentation": [
    {
      "filepath": "FEATURE_NAME_DOC.md",
      "title": "Human-Readable Feature Title",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Rich semantic description with specific technology names, patterns, and concepts. Detailed enough that an AI can route any user question to this doc by matching against this field.",
      "tags": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `description` field is critical — write it rich enough that you can route any user question to the right doc by matching against descriptions.

## Step 5 — Self-Review

Before finishing, verify:

- [ ] Every doc has at least one mermaid diagram in "How It Works"
- [ ] Every doc has at least 2 entries in "Constraints & Decisions"
- [ ] Every doc's "Key Files" lists real paths that exist in the codebase
- [ ] Every doc's "Configuration" lists actual env vars from the code
- [ ] Every doc's "Related Features" references other doc filenames
- [ ] Manifest `description` is detailed enough for semantic routing
- [ ] No doc is just a shallow restatement of file names — each explains WHY and HOW

## Rules

1. **Feature-centric, not file-centric.** One doc per logical feature, not per source file.
2. **No hallucination.** Only document what exists in code.
3. **No scripts.** Do NOT create shell scripts, scanners, or build tools. Use Read/Glob/Grep.
4. **Plan first.** Never generate without user-approved plan.
